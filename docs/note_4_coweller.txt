Alright kiddd,

Would be good to have some prototype actuators or motors (sliding gates) to test with once I've got the input stuff underway.

I've seen some nice ones on youtube that are miniature versions of the real thing. Have a source on eBay and make a document with some links, to some stuff that you thing would be good and not too expensive.

Cheers
